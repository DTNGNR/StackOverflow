# StackOverflow
This repository contains various scripts that I've written in response to questions on Stack Overflow. The scripts can be freely used and modified for any purpose.

## Languages
I don't want to restrict myself but I guess I'll just answer questions regarding this languages:
- Python
- Perl
- bash
- XSLT

## Scripts
Each script is saves as Jupyter Notebook with a link to original post on StackOverflow, the question and my suggested solution.

## How to use
Every file should be running within the Jupyter Notebook. I'll try to avoid (too) many dependencies!

## Contributing
If you have a suggestion how to improve my code than feel free to comment it on StackOverflow!
